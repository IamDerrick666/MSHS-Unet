# MSHS-Unet
Accurate medical image segmentation is a critical task in precision health; however, leading architectures like Swin-Unet are often constrained by fixed-scale feature extraction, a lack of inductive biases for small-sample learning, and suboptimal feature fusion in skip connections. To address these challenges in a unified framework, we propose the Multi-Scale Hybrid Swin-Unet. This novel architecture introduces three synergistic innovations: (1) a Multi-Scale Hybrid Swin Transformer Block that incorporates a Multi-Scale Window Attention mechanism to capture features at multiple scales in parallel; (2) a deeply integrated hybrid design featuring Convolutional Patch Operations and an embedded Convolutional Enhancer Module to balance global context with local perception; and (3) a Cross-Attention Gate to intelligently bridge the semantic gap. Extensive experiments on five diverse public datasets demonstrate that MSHS-Unet establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving a significant average Dice score improvement of 4.60% over the Swin-Unet baseline and 11.15% over seventeen competing models in cross-validation. Furthermore, in-depth ablation studies and mechanistic analyses confirm that the effectiveness of MSHS-Unet stems from the strong synergistic effect of its components, which collectively contribute to its superior accuracy and stability.
